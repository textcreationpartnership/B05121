            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY an Expreſs, which arrived here this evening, we have an account from the Camp before <hi>Limerick,</hi> That the General having reſolved to paſs the <hi>Shannon,</hi> in order to attack the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, which lay encamped in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and to ſtrengthen the Town on that ſide, the better to conceal his Deſign, made a ſhew on the 15<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> inſtant, as if he deſigned to draw off from before the Place; which the Enemy believed, and expreſſed their Joy by great and repeated Shouts. That Night a Bridge of Pontons was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed over the <hi>Shannon</hi> about a Mile above the Town; and the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, by break of day, ſeveral Squadrons of Horſe, with the <hi>Royal Regiment</hi> of Dragoons, and a Detachment of Foot, paſſed over the Bridge to a little Iſland, and having found a Ford in the other Branch of the River, waded through it without any oppoſition; As ſoon as they were diſcover'd, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Clifford,</hi> who lay encamp'd not far from thence, with 4 Regiments of Dragoons, brought down his Men on foot (their Horſes being at Graſs) to oppoſe us; but they were quickly put to flight, flinging away their Arms, and leaving all their Tents, Baggage, Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Standard of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and two Pieces of Cannon, behind them. Upon this their Camp, which lay higher up towards <hi>Killaloo,</hi> drew out, but it was only to cover their Baggage, and to get time to take down their Tents; for ſo ſoon as our Troops came near them, and had paſſed the firſt Defile that was between them and us, they marched off with what haſte they could towards the Mountains. We took a French Lieutenant-Collonel, and about 20 other Officers Priſoners; and that Evening the General ordered moſt of the Horſe and Dragoons, and 13 Regiments of Foot, to march with 5 days Proviſion of Bread into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to fight the Enemy, or at leaſt to diſperſe them. Sir <hi>Alexander Fitten, Neigle,</hi> and <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who ſtyle themſelves Lords-Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Limerick,</hi> are in the Iriſh Camp; The Confuſion among them is great, and they will quickly want Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi> was kill'd on the 15<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> by a Cannon Ball, as he was lying upon his Quilt in the Trenches.</p>
            <p>On the 17<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> one Captain <hi>Taaff</hi> came over to us, who ſaid that the Town is quite ruined; that we have killed a great number of their Men; that they have not ten days Bread in the Town, and not above 6000 Foot, and thoſe very ill clad. We continue to play our Cannon and Bombs, and doubt not but in a ſhort time to be Maſters of the Place.</p>
